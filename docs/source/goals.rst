Docxtemplater was born out of the idea that you should be able to generate Docx as easily as you generate Html with something like Mustache.

They are a lots of solutions like docx.js, docx4j, ... that generate docx, but you will have to write specific code to create a title, an image, ... I think this is a waste when you can just write your template with plain old Microsoft Word. Docxtemplater is just there for that
